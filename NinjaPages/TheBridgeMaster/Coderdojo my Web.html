	<h1> About me and Coderdojo </h1>
			<p> My name is Julia Trendel and I think Coderdojo is a fun way to learn how to code and do other things.</p>
			<p> Coderdojo teaches us how to code different things. </p>
			<p> Its a grate start for kids who want to learn codeing and use it as a job in the future. </p>
			<p> When you code you can add pictures and Youtube videos to your protect too! </p>
			<p> When you want to make a website, app, minecraft mod, or something else you can use code. </p>
