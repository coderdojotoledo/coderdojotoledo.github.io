 - question: Is there an age requirement?
   answer: "Children between the ages of 7 - 17 years old are welcome to attend CoderDojo sessions."
 - question: When is CoderDojo held?
   answer: "CoderDojo sessions are every Saturday, barring holidays or special circumstances, from noon to 3:00pm."
 - question: Do you teach a set course, what will my child learn?
   answer: "We don't adhere to any set curriculum. We have programming expertise on staff to lead short tutorials,
   provide support and resources, and help with roadblocks, but each child is working with their own technologies toward
   their own goals. For new attendees, we provide some one-on-one time to get them up to speed, figure out their goals,
   and give them the tools they need to reach them."
 - question: How many children attend?
   answer: "Right now, between 8 to 12 children regularly attend our dojo, but we'd love to have more!"
 - question: Does my child need to already know how to code?
   answer: "Not at all! We take new learners all the time and give them the direction, tools, and tutorials they need to
   learn. It is better, albeit not required, if your child has basic computer literacy: navigating the file system,
   browsing the web, and writing an email."
 - question: Do I have to stay at CoderDojo with my child?
   answer: "We do ask that parents stay at the dojo for the full session (barring extraneous circumstances) and encourage them to become active
   participants in the technology and programming community. If your child is old enough to drive, they can
   attend without parental supervision."
 - question: What should I bring?
   answer: "Children should bring a functional laptop computer with a full-featured operating system. Netbooks or tablets are
   not suitable devices for learning programming. If a computer is not available, attend anyway, and we'll work to find
   a way to get your child involved and even procure a donated laptop computer."
 - question: Should I bring snacks?
   answer: "We do encourage parents to bring snacks, baked goods, or potluck style food to share with the group.
   It is appreciated, but not required."
 - question: How do I register? Is there a certain date when you'll accept new attendees?
   answer: "Nope! No need to register. We can accept new children anytime. Simply show up, let a mentor know that
   you're new, and they'll work with you to get you set up and introduced to the club!. "
 - question: I want to help, can I mentor?
   answer: "Absolutely! If you have computer programming, design, or hardware knowledge to pass on, send us a note
   and let us know before attending. Even if you don't have those skills, reach out anyway. Dojos require more than
   just programmers to run! If your support is monetary, please reach out to us for more information."
 - question: Can I start a Dojo in my community?
   answer: "CoderDojo Toledo serves the entire Toledo and Northwest Ohio region, and our goal is to grow into multiple dojos. If you'd like to start
   one in your local community, let us know, and we'll get you the resources to get started!"
